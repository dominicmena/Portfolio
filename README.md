At first the hardest thing was figuring out how to get started.  I realized quickly that the w3 and bootstrap approaches were not how I wanted to go since it didn't help me understand how to build from the ground up.  After meeting with Ivona and seeing her grid approach, I liked that idea but once I started that way - I realized it felt arbitrary to start creating a grid when there was no content to orient so then I started watching youtube videos on building portfolios and would see how different people approached this (some started with a grid, some flexbox) and landed on one video where the guy started with putting a section in html, add a class to signify the group and an id to use in scripts. name it as the description of what the section is and then add divs > h1/h2 > p from there and style in css.  This clicked with me so I followed along to develop that same flow and it really started building from there.  I like to organize by section and then keep adding on within and sizing as needed, then moving to the next section.  Organization was a big learning in that, being very descriptive in the class/IDs helped to move quickly between html and css.
